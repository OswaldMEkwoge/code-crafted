Given an array arr[] of n integers and a target value, the task is to find whether there is a pair of elements in the array whose sum is equal to target.

Examples:
Input: arr[] = {0, -1, 2, -3, 1}, target = -2
Output: True
Explanation: There is a pair (1, -3) with the sum equal to given target, 1 + (-3) = -2

Input: arr[] = {1, -2, 1, 0, 5}, target = 0
Output: False
There is no pair with sum equals to given target
